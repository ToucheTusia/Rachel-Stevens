      <p> On the edge of voluntary.</p>

<p> The “Loading” spinner, as others have noted, represents the decoupling of the stationary, waiting body and the online affect and activation. Once in, the online is a vast landscape that we traverse by clicks and scrolls seduced into thinking that our journey has a direction and with it a destination. A place where the glass membrane can be breached and we can connect with our desired and future forms, and with one another. </p>

<p> But, as we have known for a while, this space of togetherness is colonized and governed by monopolies that further our addictions to exchange of capital, filter us into bubbles of post-truth cultures, and surveil our every move for their own economic benefit. The promise of freedom turned us from a community into a network of competitors. Each streaming from our own channels, screaming for attention and connection from isolation. </p>

<p> The pandemic forced us into physical isolation. Each apartment in the building across the street suddenly always filled with people, each feeling like only our devices could connect us to the world outside. The “poor” or “unstable” connection, the glitchy voice, the blurry face revealing and obscuring the distance and the proximity between us. A call for kinship. The glass between us un-breachable. </p>

<p> The current crisis made me realize that the value of transmission is in circulation. </p>
